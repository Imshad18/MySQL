CREATE TABLE example_table_name (
    example_column1 data_type,
    example_column2 data_type,
    example_column3 data_type
);

 CREATE TABLE book_inventory (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    publication_date DATE
);


DESCRIBE book_inventory;
If we want to know what columns are contained within a table (and their data type), we can describe them using the DESCRIBE command (which can also be abbreviated to DESC). 


ALTER TABLE book_inventory
ADD page_count INT;
Once you have created a table, there may come a time when your need for the dataset changes, and you need to alter the table. This can be done using the ALTER statement. Letâ€™s now imagine that we have decided that we actually want to have a column in our book inventory that has the page count for each book. Add this to our table using the following statement:

 DROP TABLE table_name;


CRUD
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, 

Create Operation (INSERT)
INSERT INTO books (id, name, published_date, description)
    VALUES (1, "Android Security Internals", "2014-10-14", "An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture");


Read Operation (SELECT)
SELECT * FROM books;
SELECT name, description FROM books;

Update Operation (UPDATE)
UPDATE books
    SET description = "An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture."
    WHERE id = 1;

Delete Operation (DELETE)
 DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 1;

Create (INSERT statement) - Adds a new record to the table.
Read (SELECT statement) - Retrieves record from the table.
Update (UPDATE statement) - Modifies existing data in the table.
Delete (DELETE statement) - Removes record from the table.
